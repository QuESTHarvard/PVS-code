* PVS cleaning for appending datasets
* September 2022
* N. Kapoor & R. B. Lobato

/*

This file loads country-specific raw data, cleans these data, and appends these
datasets to one clean multi-country datset. 

Cleaning includes:
	- Creating new variables (e.g., time variables) 
	- Recoding skip patterns, refused, and don't know 
	- Correcting any values and value labels and their direction 

Note: * .a means NA, .r means refused, .d is don't know, . is missing

use "$data/Kenya/00 interim data/HARVARD_Main KE CATI and F2F_08.11.22.dta", clear

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

* Fix interview length variable and other time variables 
* Edit this section to include other date and time variables as needed 

* Formatting time 
* format time_new Q46 Q47 %tcHH:MM:SS

* Converting interview length to minutes so it can be summarized

gen int_length = (hh(IntLength)*3600 + mm(IntLength)*60 + ss(IntLength)) / 60

* Converting Q46 and Q47 to minutes so it can be summarized

gen Q47_min = (hh(Q47)*3600 + mm(Q47)*60 + ss(Q47)) / 60

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

* Drop any unwanted/empty variables
* Generate any new needed variables

* Make sure no under 18 
* NOTE: TODD is this okay to do? 
drop if Q2 == 1 | Q1 < 18

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

* Recode all Refused and Don't know

* NOTE:
* Todd: for future - curious about your thoughts on over-recoding. 
* I could not do these recodes below (67 & 71) and instead do it in the value label corrections. 
* Then, would need to change all the .r in the "NA" section to 996, but that's minor 
* After you review it all, would be great to discuss your thoughts on the order of this recoding 

* Don't know is 997 in these raw data
